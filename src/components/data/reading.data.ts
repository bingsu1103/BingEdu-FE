      <h3>Why Pre-Reading Matters</h3>
      <p>Pre-reading is like warming up before exercise. It prepares your brain to absorb information more effectively and helps you approach texts with purpose and strategy.</p>
      
      <h3>Essential Pre-Reading Steps</h3>
      <p>Before you start reading, take a few minutes to survey the material. Look at headings, subheadings, images, and any highlighted text. This gives you a roadmap of what's to come.</p>
      
      <h3>Setting Reading Goals</h3>
      <p>Ask yourself: What do I want to learn from this text? Are you reading for general understanding, specific information, or critical analysis? Your purpose will guide your reading strategy.</p>
      
      <h3>Activating Prior Knowledge</h3>
      <p>Think about what you already know about the topic. This creates mental hooks for new information and helps you make connections as you read.</p>

      <h3>What is Active Reading?</h3>
      <p>Active reading means engaging with the text through questioning, note-taking, and making connections. It's the difference between simply looking at words and truly understanding meaning.</p>
      
      <h3>The Power of Annotation</h3>
      <p>Don't just readâ€”interact with the text. Highlight key points, write questions in margins, and summarize paragraphs in your own words.</p>
      
      <h3>Question Everything</h3>
      <p>Good readers are curious readers. Ask questions before, during, and after reading. What does this mean? How does this connect to what I already know? What evidence supports this claim?</p>
      
      <h3>Making Connections</h3>
      <p>Connect new information to your personal experiences, other texts you've read, or current events. These connections make information more memorable and meaningful.</p>

      <h3>The Context Clue Detective</h3>
      <p>When you encounter an unfamiliar word, don't immediately reach for the dictionary. Instead, become a detective and use the surrounding text to infer meaning.</p>
      
      <h3>Types of Context Clues</h3>
      <p>Definition clues provide direct explanations. Example clues show the word in action. Contrast clues show what the word is NOT. Inference clues require you to read between the lines.</p>
      
      <h3>Word Parts Strategy</h3>
      <p>Break down unfamiliar words into prefixes, roots, and suffixes. Understanding common word parts can help you decode thousands of English words.</p>
      
      <h3>Building Your Word Bank</h3>
      <p>Keep a vocabulary journal. Write new words, their meanings, and example sentences. Review regularly to move words from recognition to active use.</p>

      <h3>The Science of Speed Reading</h3>
      <p>Speed reading isn't about skimming or sacrificing comprehension. It's about eliminating inefficient reading habits and training your brain to process text more effectively.</p>
      
      <h3>Eliminating Subvocalization</h3>
      <p>Most people "hear" words in their head while reading. This internal voice limits your reading speed to speaking speed. Learn techniques to reduce this habit gradually.</p>
      
      <h3>Expanding Your Visual Span</h3>
      <p>Instead of reading word by word, train your eyes to take in chunks of text. This reduces the number of eye movements needed and increases reading speed.</p>
      
      <h3>The Importance of Practice</h3>
      <p>Like any skill, speed reading requires consistent practice. Start with easier texts and gradually work up to more complex material as your skills improve.</p>

      <h3>Beyond Surface Reading</h3>

      <p>Academic texts are rich with discipline-specific terminology. Create glossaries, use context clues, and don't hesitate to look up key terms that appear repeatedly.</p>
